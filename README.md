# OTN Modern Client Project

## What's this?
The OTN Modern Client Project is a project for making implimentations of the OTN Client in modern devices. This can range from things that make sense to the most random thing ever that would never be used, but exists because we thought it would be funny or we got bored.

The point of this is to make it so "Old to New" doesn't mean it only has to bridge the gap between old computers and modern printers. Why not have one central hub for printing, and let all your devices print to that one printer - old or new? (and we got bored)

In order to see the different implimentations, you can browse the branches. Every implimentation will be there. The master branch is only for documentation.

## Under Construction!
At this point in time, this website is under construction, so below is a list of all the implimentations of OTNMCP there are.
