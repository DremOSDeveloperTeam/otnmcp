# OTN Modern Client Project

## What's this?
The OTN Modern Client Project is a project for making implimentations of the OTN Client in modern devices. This can range from things that make sense to the most random thing ever that would never be used, but exists because we thought it would be funny or we got bored.

The point of this is to make it so "Old to New" doesn't mean it only has to bridge the gap between old computers and modern printers. Why not have one central hub for printing, and let all your devices print to that one printer - old or new? (and we got bored)

In order to see the different implimentations, you can browse the branches. Every implimentation will be there. The master branch is only for documentation.

## How does it work?
On many devices, it can be impossible or tedius to use the Telnet client originally provided with OTN. We saw this as a problem, and wanted to be able to expand OTN to more than just old devices. That's where the OTN Modern Clients come in.

Starting with OTN release 0.1.3, there will be 3 different ways to upload a document to the server - Telnet, HTTP, and FTP. You can toggle the avalibility of the HTTP and FTP servers with the `server-configurator.bat` program. The Telnet client is not able to be turned off.

### Telnet Client
The Telnet client is the stock client for OTN. It is explained on [the main OTN repository](https://github.com/sparrdrem/otn).

### HTTP Client
The HTTP client, is a client that is accessible from your web browser! It is also used by some modern clients such as the Chrome extension. The HTTP server is built around MiniWeb.

## Under Construction!
At this point in time, this website is under construction, so below is a list of all the implimentations of OTNMCP there are.
